   <center><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2></center>

   <h3>Do you have a free plan?</h3>

   <p>
      Absolutely. One book and daily reports are yours for free. This is an ad supported option, but you can remove the 
      ads by opting-in to a paid plan.
   </p>

   <h3>How does your subscription plan work?</h3>

   <p>Simple. At the end of your subscription period we'll invoice you for the same plan. Would you prefer not to be on a subscription? 
   No problem. Just go to your profile and turn it off.</p>

   <h3>Can I cancel anytime?</h3>

   <p>Absolutely. We offer a no questions asked cancelation policy. If you are unhappy with the service, contact us
   at info@bestsellersrank.me, and we'll cancel your service and give you a prorated refund.</p>

   <h3>Can I get a refund?</h3>

   <p>Absolutely. We offer a 7-day no questions asked refund policy. If you are unhappy with the service for any reason, contact us
   at info@bestsellersrank.me, and we'll give you a full refund right away. After 7 days it's simply a service cancelation and you'll
   receive a prorated refund.</p>

   <h3>Can I change plans?</h3>

   <p>Absolutely. If you choose to upgrade we'll charge you for the new plan and extend your service period 
   based on how much time you have remaining on your previous plan.</p>

   <p>If you choose to downgrade we'll add more time to your service period based on the cost difference between the plans
   and how much you have remaining on your previous plan.</p>

   <h3>Can I create a custom plan?</h3>

   <p>Absolutely. Just email us at info@bestsellersrank.me, and we'll work something out. We're trying to keep the plans as simple as possible,
   so we don't want to make things complex by default.</p>

   <h3>What sites are included on Best Sellers Rank reports?</h3>

   <p>Currently, Best Sellers Rank only works on the Amazon.com book store. In the future? Sky's the limit. We have big plans for new features.</p>
